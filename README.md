# 2048 Game Solver

A project I did for my Master's degree where I used the Monte-Carlo Tree Search method to attempt to beat the game 2048.

Here's a video of the AI in action using the Selenium web browser to visualise the process.

## Setup

Initialise a virtual environment from `requirements.txt`, then navigate to `playground.ipynb` and press "Run All".

### Mac Setup

You don't need to do anything else!

### Windows Setup

I have never run this on a Windows machine, so you'll need to navigate to [this](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) link to download a web driver.

## Credits

Note that for this project, the source code for the game 2048 is included within my repository for ease of running. 

The OFFICIAL github repository by Gabriel Cirulli is available here: https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

Such code used may be found in the folder labelled "2048".
